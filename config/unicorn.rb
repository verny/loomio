# Sample verbose configuration file for Unicorn (not Rack)
#
# This configuration file documents many features of Unicorn
# that may not be needed for some applications. See
# http://unicorn.bogomips.org/examples/unicorn.conf.minimal.rb
# for a much simpler configuration file.
#
# See http://unicorn.bogomips.org/Unicorn/Configurator.html for complete
# documentation.
# Set the current app's path for later reference. Rails.root isn't available at
# this point, so we have to point up a directory.
app_path = File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/..')
# Use at least one worker per core if you're on a dedicated server,
# more will usually help for _short_ waits on databases/caches.

# Since Unicorn is never exposed to outside clients, it does not need to
# run on the standard HTTP port (80), there is no reason to start Unicorn
# as root unless it's from system init scripts.
# If running the master process as root and the workers as an unprivileged
# user, do this to switch euid/egid in the workers (also chowns logs):
# user "unprivileged_user", "unprivileged_group"

# Help ensure your application will always spawn in the symlinked
# "current" directory that Capistrano sets up.
